## **Part 2: Creating a Wallet Using MetaMask**  

1. **Open MetaMask**  
   - After installation, click the **fox icon** in your browser.

2. **Get Started**  
   - Click on **"Get Started"** when MetaMask launches.

3. **Create a Wallet**

   - Choose a **strong password** (at least 8 characters) to protect your wallet.  
   - Make sure you remember this password.  

5. **Backup your Secret Recovery Phrase**  
   - MetaMask will generate a **12-word Secret Recovery Phrase**.  
   - **Write this phrase down** on paper and store it safely.  
     - **IMPORTANT:** If you lose this phrase, you won’t be able to recover your wallet.  
     - **Never share** it with anyone. This phrase gives full access to your wallet.

6. **Verify your Recovery Phrase**  
   - MetaMask will ask you to **enter the 12 words in the correct order** to confirm you’ve saved it properly.

7. **Wallet Created!**  
   - After verification, your **wallet is ready**. You will see:
     - **Wallet Address**: A unique address starting with `0x...`.
     - **ETH Balance**: Initially, this will be **0 ETH**.

### **How to Add Ether (ETH) to Your Wallet**  
- You can add ETH by:
  1. **Buying ETH through MetaMask**: MetaMask provides options to buy ETH via third-party services (like MoonPay or Wyre).
  2. **Receiving ETH from another wallet**:
     - **Click "Receive"** in MetaMask and **copy your wallet address**.
     - Share the address with the person sending you ETH.

## **Part 3: Sending Ether (ETH) and Understanding Gas Fees**  

1. **Open MetaMask**  
   - Click on the **fox icon** to open MetaMask.

2. **Click "Send"**  
   - Enter the **wallet address** of the recipient (the person you want to send ETH to).

3. **Enter the Amount**  
   - Specify how much ETH you want to send (e.g., 0.5 ETH).

4. **Set the Gas Fee**  
   - Gas fees are **paid in Ether** to reward miners or validators for processing the transaction.  
   - The **gas price** is measured in **gwei** (1 gwei = 0.000000001 ETH).  
     - **Higher gas fees** ensure faster transactions.
     - **Lower gas fees** may result in slower transactions or failure during network congestion.

5. **Confirm the Transaction**  
   - Review the details, including the gas fee.
   - Click **Confirm** to send the ETH.

6. **Wait for Confirmation**  
   - The transaction will be processed within a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the gas fee.

### **How Ether is Spent Per Transaction (Gas Fees)**  
Whenever you perform a transaction on the Ethereum network (like **sending ETH** or **interacting with smart contracts**), you need to **pay gas fees**. Here’s a breakdown:  

- **Gas Unit**: A measure of computational effort required for the transaction.  
- **Gas Price**: The amount you are willing to pay per unit of gas (in gwei).  
- **Transaction Fee** = Gas Units × Gas Price  

**Example**:  
- You send **1 ETH** to a friend.  
- Gas required: **21,000 units**  
- Gas price: **50 gwei**  
- Total gas fee = 21,000 × 50 gwei = 1,050,000 gwei = **0.00105 ETH**

### **Part 4: Example Walkthrough of Sending ETH**  

1. **Current Wallet Balance**:  
   2 ETH

2. **Sending Transaction**:  
   You send **0.5 ETH** to your friend.

3. **Gas Fee**:  
   - Gas used: **21,000 units**  
   - Gas price: **30 gwei**  
   - Fee: **0.00063 ETH**

4. **Total Deduction**:  
   0.5 ETH + 0.00063 ETH = **0.50063 ETH**  

5. **New Wallet Balance**:  
   2 ETH - 0.50063 ETH = **1.49937 ETH**
